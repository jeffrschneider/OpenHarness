## Tips for Substitutions

1. **Start with less** - You can always add more
2. **Consider the role** - Is it for flavor, texture, binding, or leavening?
3. **Test first** - Try substitutions in small batches
4. **Combine when needed** - Sometimes two subs work better than one
5. **Adjust other ingredients** - Subs may affect salt, sweetness, or moisture
