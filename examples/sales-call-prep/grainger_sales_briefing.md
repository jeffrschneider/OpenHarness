|------|----------------|
| **New role energy** | 5-6 weeks in — still in discovery mode, open to new ideas |
| **Distributed Dojo success** | Her signature achievement at Capital One; shows she values enablement over gatekeeping |
| **Engineering culture alignment** | She explicitly praised Grainger's engineering focus — validate this choice |
| **Platform engineering focus** | Her title signals internal platform/developer experience priorities |
| **CTO pedigree** | LeRoy from ThoughtWorks = strong engineering culture from top down |

---

## 4. PAIN POINT SIGNALS

### Technical Challenges (Company-Wide)
| Pain Point | Evidence | Severity |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Legacy system silos** | Fragmented architecture across business units | High |
| **Data fragmentation** | High-Touch vs. Endless Assortment segments not unified | High |
| **Scale pressure** | 400K daily product updates to process | Medium |
| **Integration complexity** | Proprietary PIM/CIM + Databricks + new AI tools | Medium |

### Role-Specific Hypotheses (Aimee's Likely Priorities)
Based on her background and the VP Infrastructure & Platform Engineering title:

1. **Platform consolidation** — Unifying infrastructure across legacy silos
2. **Developer experience** — Her Dojo background suggests internal enablement focus
3. **Observability at scale** — 400K daily updates requires robust monitoring
4. **AI infrastructure** — Supporting the quadrupled AI/ML team's needs
5. **Proving value early** — New leader needs visible wins in first 90 days

---

## 5. RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Warm Call Strategy

Since you know Aimee personally, lead with the relationship, not the pitch.

**Tone:** Collegial check-in → genuine curiosity → helpful resource

### Opening Lines

**Option A — Direct Congratulations**
> "Aimee, congrats on the Grainger move — saw your post about the first week. How's the lay of the land looking now that you're a few weeks in?"

**Option B — Engineering Culture Angle**
> "I saw you mentioned Grainger's engineering-focused culture. Coming from the retail side at Foot Locker, what's surprised you most about industrial B2B?"

**Option C — New Leader Discovery**
> "You're probably still in assessment mode — what's on your radar for the first 90 days?"

### Transition to Business (When Natural)

> "I've been watching what Grainger's doing with AI — the RAG search, KeepStock vision work. Is your team supporting that infrastructure, or is that sitting elsewhere?"

### What NOT to Do
- Don't pitch immediately — she's in listening mode herself
- Don't assume pain points — let her surface them
- Don't name-drop her Dojo work unless she brings it up (feels researched)

---

## 6. QUESTIONS TO ASK

### Discovery Questions (Warm Relationship Style)

**Role & Scope**
- "What's the split between infrastructure and platform on your team? Are those unified or separate orgs?"
- "Who are your internal customers — is it mostly the AI/ML teams or broader engineering?"

**Current State**
- "How mature is the platform story at Grainger? Building from scratch or optimizing what's there?"
- "With the Databricks investment and the AI work, where does your team plug in?"

**Pain Point Exploration**
- "Any inherited technical debt that's keeping you up at night?"
- "What's the hardest part about supporting 400K daily product updates at the infrastructure level?"

**Priorities**
- "What does success look like for you in the first year?"
- "Anything you're looking to bring over from the Foot Locker or Capital One playbook?"

**Buying Signals to Listen For**
- Mentions of "evaluating vendors" or "looking at options"
- Frustration with current tooling or processes
- Specific initiatives with timelines
- Budget or headcount discussions
