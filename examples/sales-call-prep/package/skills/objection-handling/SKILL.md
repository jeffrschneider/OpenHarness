# Objection Handling

## Overview

This skill catalogs common sales objections and effective response strategies. It helps contextualize past objections and prepare for potential pushback.

## Usage

The main agent references this skill when:
- Reviewing history of objections with a prospect
- Preparing talking points for follow-up calls
- Analyzing patterns in objection frequency

## Common Objection Categories

### Pricing Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Reframe to ROI; quantify cost of status quo |
| "Over budget" | Explore phased approach or smaller pilot |
| "Competitor is cheaper" | Differentiate on value, TCO, or risk |
| "No budget until next quarter" | Agree on timeline; nurture until then |

### Timing Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Not a priority right now" | Understand current priorities; find alignment |
| "Too busy to implement" | Offer white-glove onboarding or phased rollout |
| "Mid-contract with incumbent" | Get on calendar for contract renewal window |
| "Need to wait for [event]" | Calendar follow-up; provide value in interim |

### Authority Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "I need to check with my boss" | Offer to join that conversation |
| "This needs committee approval" | Provide materials for internal selling |
| "Not my decision" | Ask for intro to decision maker |
| "We have a process for this" | Understand and work within their process |

### Trust/Risk Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Never heard of you" | Provide references, case studies, logos |
| "Concerned about switching costs" | Quantify switching costs vs. staying |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | Offer pilot, POC, or guarantee |
| "Had bad experience with similar" | Acknowledge; differentiate your approach |

### Technical Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Doesn't integrate with X" | Explore workarounds; roadmap discussion |
| "Missing feature Y" | Understand criticality; product feedback loop |
| "Security concerns" | Provide security documentation, certifications |
| "Too complex" | Offer demo focused on their use case |

## Objection Tracking

When logging objections, capture:
- Exact objection wording
- Context (when in conversation, who raised it)
- Response used
- Outcome (overcame, lost, pending)

This builds institutional knowledge for future calls.
