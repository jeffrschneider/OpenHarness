# Pricing Objection Deep Dive

## Understanding Price Objections

Price objections are rarely just about price. They're usually about:
- **Value clarity** - Don't understand the ROI
- **Budget allocation** - Money exists but earmarked elsewhere
- **Comparison** - Benchmarking against alternatives
- **Negotiation** - Testing for discount
- **Authority** - Need ammunition for internal approval

## Diagnosis Questions

Before responding, understand the real issue:

1. "When you say expensive, what are you comparing it to?"
2. "Help me understand—is this a budget constraint or a value question?"
3. "If price weren't a factor, would this be the right solution?"
4. "What would need to be true for this investment to make sense?"

## Response Strategies by Type

### Value Clarity Issue

**Signal:** "I don't see how this is worth $X"

**Strategy:** Quantify the value

**Script:**
> "Let's make the value concrete. You mentioned [pain point] is costing you [time/money/risk]. Based on what you've told me, addressing that is worth approximately [calculation]. Our solution costs [price], so the ROI is [X]. Does that math resonate?"

**Tools:**
- ROI calculator
- Case study with metrics
- Benchmarking data

### Budget Allocation Issue

**Signal:** "We don't have budget for this"

**Strategy:** Find budget or change timeline

**Questions:**
- "When does your fiscal year start?"
- "Who owns budget for [this area]?"
- "Is there a way to reallocate from [related area]?"
- "Would a phased approach fit better?"

**Options:**
- Q4/Q1 planning timing
- Different budget owner
- Pilot at lower price point
- Multi-year deal with better year-1 terms

### Competitive Comparison Issue

**Signal:** "Competitor is 30% cheaper"

**Strategy:** Differentiate, don't discount

**Framework:**
1. Validate the comparison is apples-to-apples
2. Highlight feature/scope differences
3. Address total cost of ownership
4. Provide social proof of value

**Script:**
> "I want to make sure we're comparing the same thing. Does their quote include [feature 1], [feature 2], [support level]? [Listen] When customers compare us directly, they often find [differentiation]. Plus, when you factor in [hidden cost: implementation, training, integration], the total picture changes. Here's what [similar customer] found when they evaluated both."

### Negotiation Attempt

**Signal:** "Can you do better on price?"

**Strategy:** Trade, don't cave

**Options:**
- Multi-year commitment for discount
- Reduced scope for lower price
- Payment terms flexibility
- Added value instead of discount

**Script:**
> "I want to find a way to work together. Our pricing reflects the value we deliver, but there are a few ways we could structure this differently. If you commit to [term/scope], I can [offer]. Would that work?"

### Internal Approval Issue

**Signal:** "My CFO will never approve this"

**Strategy:** Arm them for the conversation

**Provide:**
- One-page executive summary
- ROI analysis document
- Peer customer references
- Offer to join the CFO call

**Script:**
> "I want to make sure you have what you need for that conversation. What does your CFO typically want to see? I can put together a one-pager with [ROI, comparisons, references]. Or, I'd be happy to join that call and address questions directly."

## Price Anchoring Techniques

### Anchor High, Then Show Value
Present full price first, then demonstrate value that exceeds it.

### Compare to Cost of Inaction
Calculate what the problem costs today (time, money, risk).

### Show Industry Benchmarks
"Companies your size typically invest $X-Y in this area."

### Amortize the Cost
Break annual cost into daily/monthly: "That's less than $X per employee per day."

## When to Walk Away

Not every deal is right:
- Customer truly can't afford it (budget reality)
- Value isn't there for their use case
- They're only shopping for a price to beat elsewhere
- Discount would set bad precedent

**Exit gracefully:**
> "Based on where things are, it sounds like the timing or fit isn't right. I appreciate you being upfront. Would it make sense to reconnect [when circumstances change]?"
