# Booking Timing Tips

## Flights

### Domestic Flights
- **Sweet spot:** 1-3 months before departure
- **Best day to book:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Best day to fly:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday
- **Avoid:** Booking less than 2 weeks out (prices spike)

### International Flights
- **Sweet spot:** 2-8 months before departure
- **Peak seasons:** Book 4-6 months ahead
- **Best time of day:** Early morning or late night departures often cheaper

### Price Monitoring
- Set alerts on Google Flights, Kayak, or Hopper
- Prices typically lowest 6 weeks before domestic, 3 months before international
- Consider nearby airports for significant savings

## Hotels

### Best Booking Windows
- **Business hotels:** Book same week for deals (low weekend occupancy)
- **Resort/vacation:** 1-4 months ahead
- **Peak season:** 6+ months for popular destinations

### Price Strategies
- Check hotel direct site vs OTAs (often price match + perks)
- Loyalty programs can offer 10-25% off
- Flexible dates? Check entire week for price variance

## Tours & Activities
- **Popular attractions:** Book 2-4 weeks ahead
- **Skip-the-line tickets:** Essential for major sites, book early
- **Local tours:** Often cheaper booked locally, but risky during peak

### Ryokans
- Popular ones book 3-6 months ahead
