# Travel Research Agent

## Description

An agent that plans detailed trips based on your destination, dates, budget, and preferences.

Given a trip request, the agent researches flights, accommodations, activities, and logistics, then produces a complete day-by-day itinerary. It asks clarifying questions about travel style, dietary needs, mobility considerations, and interests to personalize recommendations.

The agent remembers your preferences across sessions. If you've traveled before, it recalls what you liked and disliked ("you mentioned avoiding group tours," "last trip you loved the hole-in-the-wall restaurants").

For complex trips, the agent breaks the work into phases—transportation, lodging, activities, dining, logistics—and provides progress updates as it researches each area.

**What the agent needs from you:**
- Destination and travel dates
- Number of travelers and any relevant details (ages, dietary restrictions, mobility needs)
- Budget (total or per-day)
- Travel style preferences (luxury vs. budget, adventure vs. relaxation, tourist highlights vs. off-the-beaten-path)

## Example Session

```
User: Plan a 10-day family trip to Japan in April. Budget is around $8,000 not including flights.

Agent: I'd love to help plan your Japan trip! A few questions to make sure I get this right:

1. Who's traveling? (ages, any dietary restrictions or mobility considerations?)
2. Is this your first time in Japan?
3. What's your travel style—packed itinerary hitting major sights, or slower pace with time to wander?
4. Any must-see places or experiences? Anything you want to avoid?

User: Me and my wife, two kids (8 and 12). First time for all of us. Kids are adventurous eaters. We want to see the highlights but not be exhausted—maybe one big thing per day with downtime. Must-see: Tokyo, Kyoto. Want to skip: group tours.

Agent: Perfect. A family of 4, first-timers, highlights-focused with a relaxed pace, Tokyo and Kyoto anchors, no group tours.

I'll research this in phases:
- Tokyo accommodations (family-friendly, central location)
- Kyoto accommodations
- Transportation between cities (JR Pass options)
- Activities suited for kids 8-12
- Restaurant recommendations (adventurous but approachable)

I'll have a draft itinerary for you shortly. This usually takes a few minutes.

Agent: Here's your draft 10-day Japan itinerary:

**Days 1-4: Tokyo**
- Accommodation: Shibuya Excel Hotel Tokyu (connecting rooms available, $180/night)
- Day 1: Arrive, Shibuya crossing, casual ramen dinner
- Day 2: teamLab Borderless (kids will love it), Harajuku walking
- Day 3: Senso-ji Temple morning, Akihabara arcade afternoon
- Day 4: Day trip to Studio Ghibli Museum (tickets required 1 month ahead!)

**Days 5-7: Kyoto**
- Accommodation: Traditional ryokan in Gion ($250/night, futons, communal bath—great cultural experience for kids)
- Day 5: Train to Kyoto (2.5 hrs), Fushimi Inari (thousands of torii gates, kids can run ahead)
- Day 6: Arashiyama bamboo grove morning, monkey park (kids love feeding the monkeys)
- Day 7: Nijo Castle, cooking class making gyoza

**Days 8-9: Osaka**
- Accommodation: Cross Hotel Osaka ($150/night)
- Day 8: Train to Osaka (15 min), Osaka Aquarium, Dotonbori food street
- Day 9: Universal Studios Japan (splurge day)

**Day 10: Departure**
- Morning: last-minute shopping
- Train to KIX airport

**Budget breakdown:**
- Accommodations: $1,980
- JR Pass (family of 4): $1,200
- Activities & admissions: $800
- Food (~$150/day): $1,500
- Misc/buffer: $520
- **Total: $6,000** (under budget by $2,000)

Want me to adjust anything? I can add more activities, upgrade accommodations, or shift the pace.

User: This looks great. Can we swap Universal Studios for something more cultural? And the ryokan sounds amazing but will the kids be okay with communal baths?

Agent: Good questions.

**Universal swap:** For Day 9 in Osaka, I'd suggest Himeji Castle instead—it's Japan's most spectacular original castle, about 1 hour from Osaka. The kids can explore the steep wooden stairs and hidden rooms. Pair it with the neighboring Koko-en Garden. This saves ~$400 in admission fees too.

**Ryokan baths:** Most ryokans offer private "family bath" time slots you can reserve (usually 45 min). I'll note that you'd want to request this when booking. Alternatively, I can find a ryokan with in-room private baths—they exist but cost ~$100/night more.

Which do you prefer?

User: Himeji sounds perfect. Let's do the ryokan with private family bath time.

Agent: Done. I've updated the itinerary:
- Day 9 is now Himeji Castle + Koko-en Garden
- Ryokan note: request private family bath slot at booking

I'll finalize the document with all details, confirmation links, and a packing checklist for Japan in April (cherry blossom season—bring layers and allergy meds if needed).

Ready to export?

User: Yes, let's do it.

Agent: Your complete itinerary is ready.
